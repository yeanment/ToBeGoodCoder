## Comments on Several CS Courses
### [Missing Semester MIT 2020S](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
This course does cover somthing encountered but never taught officially in classrooms. Through this course, I have a brief understanding of the shell programming and starts to know something about github pages. Following the advices, I can achieve something quiet interesting like hosting personal blog on Github. I also learn to use github actions for auto-processing. That's amazing. For me, the most valuable knowledge is
- Shell
- Sematic Version
- Github Pages & Github Actions

As for the other topics, they do cover something, but this is not enough. It's quiet good to make people familiar with some concepts. But we need to do more.
